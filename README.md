# ChatGPT Software Architict Roadmap

These points were generated through an insane chat with ChatGPT. I find this quite an insane outcome with amazing amount of detail and resources. I'll most probably follow some of these points and see where it leads. 
While some points are repeated and some could have been better, it does prove to be quite a reference. and the fact that all this info came out of a 10 min convo is still insane.
